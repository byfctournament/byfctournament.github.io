If coming by car, please try to car-share where possible: it is good for the environment and fewer cars means you will be able to park more quickly. 

A number of buses run from Maidstone town centre up the Tonbridge Road and there is a bus stop at Oakwood Park. Bus numbers include: 3, 6, and 7.

If you are driving, please enter the tournament by the main gate on Queen's Road. The entrance to Oakwood Park along the Tonbridge Road side will be closed to traffic for the tournament. Enter ME16 0LD into your satnav.

The map above shows you where there places to park (in orange). There will be parking attendants to help you, but it will be helpful if you familiarise yourself with the parking options. The numbers indicate the number of spaces.
