*Please note that the Tonbridge Road entrance to the tournament will be blocked,
please enter the tournament via Queens Road.*

If coming by car, please try to car-share where possible: it is good for the
environment and fewer cars means you will be able to park more quickly.

If you wish to park on-site, please buy a programme for £3.

A number of buses run from Maidstone town centre up the Tonbridge Road and there
is a bus stop at Oakwood Park. Bus numbers include: 3, 6, and 7.

If you are driving, please enter the tournament by the main gate on Queen's
Road. The entrance to Oakwood Park along the Tonbridge Road side will be closed
to traffic for the tournament. Enter ME16 0LD into your satnav.
