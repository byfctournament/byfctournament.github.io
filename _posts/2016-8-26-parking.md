*Please note that the Tonbridge Road is blocked between the junction with Fountain Lane/Farleigh Lane and Queens Road due to a large hole in the road. Buses are taking routes around it and journey times are longer as a result. If coming by car from the Tonbridge side of the town, it will best to go down Hermitage Lane, along the London Road (A20), then up Queens Road.*

If coming by car, please try to car-share where possible: it is good for the environment and fewer cars means you will be able to park more quickly. 

A number of buses run from Maidstone town centre up the Tonbridge Road and there is a bus stop at Oakwood Park. Bus numbers include: 3, 6, and 7.

If you are driving, please enter the tournament by the main gate on Queen's Road. The entrance to Oakwood Park along the Tonbridge Road side will be closed to traffic for the tournament. Enter ME16 0LD into your satnav.

The map above shows you where there places to park (in orange). There will be parking attendants to help you, but it will be helpful if you familiarise yourself with the parking options. The numbers indicate the number of spaces.
