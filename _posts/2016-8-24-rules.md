Goalkeepers are not penalised for going outside the goal area unless they handle the ball.<br />For 5-a-side football only the goalkeeper is allowed inside the goal area. If an outfield player gains an advantage by entering the area, penalties are as follows: -<br />(a)   by the defence---penalty kick. Please note that if a defender unintentionally enters the area and gains no advantage a penalty will NOT be given.<br />(b)   by the attack---ball is given to goalkeeper to roll out.<br />If the goalkeeper goes out of the penalty area and gains an advantage a penalty will be awarded.
